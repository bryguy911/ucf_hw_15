The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, ecosystem health, environmental conditions, and the impacts of climate and land-use changes. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS aims to build new tools to visualize their earthquake data. Although they collect a massive amount of data from around the world daily, they currently lack an effective way to display it. The challenge is to develop a visualization method for USGS data to better educate the public and other government organizations and potentially secure more funding for addressing issues facing our planet.

The activity is divided into two parts:

Create the Earthquake Visualization:

Gather and Plot More Data (Optional with no extra points earning):

Plot a second dataset on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.

The tectonic plates dataset can be found here.

Tasks to perform:

Plot the tectonic plates dataset on the map in addition to the earthquakes.

Add other base maps to choose from.

Put each dataset into separate overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

Add layer controls to the map.
